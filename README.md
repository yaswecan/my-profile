### Hi there üëã

I'm Yaswecan,

As you already know, you're not here by accident. You came through the web to my GitHub profile. And you didn't pay for that, right?

The web and technology we love have been built by a community of passionate people, driven by a desire to share knowledge before thinking about how much they can sell their work for. 

I aspire to be one of those people who contribute by sharing knowledge and being useful to the community.

This is why I find it cool to call myself Cityzen99 üòÇ (if you get the reference).

Jokes aside, I'm a MERN STACK Web Developer. My experience has equipped me with the technical skills and knowledge necessary to successfully support a company and its IT team by providing reliable and sustainable software solutions for any web-based platform.

‚ô•Ô∏è I enjoy making people laugh and helping them grow, both personally and in coding.
